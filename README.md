## User Story

In a world where we need to limit how many people we are exposed to, we wanted to create an app that makes it easy to reach out, find a doctor and make appointments remotely.


## What do We Do?

We connect patients to Doctors in a stress-free way.

## Motivation

One of the collaborators Jose works in the medical field and noticed that it's hard to get a hold of a doctor directly and schedule an appointment. As a group we want to see what we could do to eliminate that.


## Technologies

MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Apollo-Express, JavaScript, React-Bootstrap, React-Router, CSS, JWT

## What we learned

We learned a lot about backend to front end connections, prioritizing time as a group, and how to play up to our strengths as a team and individually
