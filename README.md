# Health-App2

## What do We Do?

We connect patients to Doctors in a stress-free way.

## Motivation

One of the collaborators Jose works in the health industry and noticed that it's hard to get a hold of a doctor directly and schedule an appointment. As a group we want to see what we could do to eliminate that.

## Tools Used

Javascript, queries, React, graphql, bootstrap, css

We learned a lot about backend to front end connections, prioritizing time as a group, and how to play up to our strengths as a team and individually
